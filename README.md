# 🚀 Memecoin Hackathon Project

Welcome to our **Memecoin Hackathon Project**! 🎉 This project is a fun and innovative platform designed to explore the use of memecoins with a playful approach while showcasing our technical expertise in web development. 🌐💡

## 🌟 **Overview**

Our project revolves around building a **web application** that allows users to:

1. **Log in and Log out** securely. 🔒
2. **Capture images** directly from the frontend. 📸
3. Store captured images using `localStorage`. 🗂️

We have built the **backend** using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The project is designed with scalability, security, and user-friendliness in mind.
